## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Ask about SEO keywords before you've written anything
✅ **Do**: Focus on title, topic, and angle first - SEO comes later

❌ **Don't**: Try to cover everything in one post
✅ **Do**: Choose one angle and go deep on that

❌ **Don't**: Write without knowing your audience
✅ **Do**: Be specific about who you're writing for

❌ **Don't**: Bury the main point at the end
✅ **Do**: Make your key insight clear early

❌ **Don't**: Publish without a call to action
✅ **Do**: Tell readers what to do next
